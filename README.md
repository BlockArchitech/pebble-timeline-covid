# COVID-19 to Pebble Timeline
Using the disease.sh api, A Pebble app, and a python script, to let people know just a little bit more on what's happening outside.

## What's this?
This is a simple project I'm taking on to create a pebble app to push pins to the pebble timeline.

## How does it work?

What I was *going* to do, would use a Flask web server. My testing has shown this is not the best way to get data.

Now, I'm just going to use a pebble.js app, and most of the code will be on the phone.

## What's a pebble?
Pebble was a smartwatch company that made the first real smartwatch in 2013. The pebble brand and products have since been discontinued, but it's still fun to develop for.
